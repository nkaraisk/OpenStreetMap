# 🗺️ OpenStreetMap

## 📚 Overview

This assignment involves working with OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to perform geographic data analysis and visualization. It implements algorithms to process OSM files, extract relevant information, and answer queries about map features such as roads, intersections, and routes.

---
## 🛠️ Requirements

- Programming language: (Specify as per your course, e.g., Python, Java, C++)
- Libraries: (List any required libraries, e.g., osmread, matplotlib, etc.)
- Input: OSM data files (XML or PBF format)
- Output: Answers to queries, visualizations, or processed data files

---
## 📝 Operations

1. **OSM Data Parsing**: Reads and parses the provided OSM file to extract nodes, ways, and relations.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Identifies and extracts map features such as roads, intersections, and points of interest.
3. **Query Implementation**: Implements functions to answer queries about:
   - 🛣️ Road connectivity
   - 🚗 Shortest paths/routes
   - 🚦 Intersection details
   - 🏙️ Other map features as specified in the assignment
4. **Visualization (if required)**: Generates visual representations of the map or query results.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the main script with the OSM file as input:
   ```bash
   python main.py <osm_file.osm>
   ```
3. Follow instructions in the assignment PDF for specific usage and queries.
